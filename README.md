# Welcome
   
   
I regularly receive various printers for repair or design and installation of improvements. However, the last project, due to the fact that I had a lot of freedom of redevelopment, seems to be quite interesting and the end result is so satisfactory that I decided to present it and make the project files available to everyone interested. From the base printer I used the frame, the Y axis mechanics, or the max part of the extruder. The mechanics and housing have been completely redesigned. The printer also got new electronics and clipper software. All design files are available with CAD for DesignSpark Mechanical and STL files. A short presentation is available on YouTube.: [Video Anycubic by Mario Printers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtKOWbEIliU&ab_channel=MarioM)
